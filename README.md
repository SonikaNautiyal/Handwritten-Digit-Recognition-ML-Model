# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-ML-Model
This repository contains a Machine Learning project to recognize handwritten digits from the widely-used MNIST dataset. Using Python and popular ML libraries, this project demonstrates how a model can be trained to accurately predict handwritten digits.

Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. This project leverages supervised learning algorithms to classify digits (0-9) from images, based on pixel values. The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Loading and normalizing image data
Model Building: Building and training ML models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance and accuracy on test data
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.
