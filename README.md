# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Python and Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using machine learning and Python. We use the **MNIST dataset**, a popular benchmark for digit recognition tasks, and build models to classify digits from 28x28 pixel images.  

## Project Overview  

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision, often used to teach machine learning concepts. This project involves:  
- Loading and processing image data  
- Training machine learning models to recognize digits  
- Evaluating model accuracy  
- Predicting new handwritten digits  

This is an excellent project to learn the basics of machine learning and image classification!  

## Dataset  

We use the **MNIST dataset**, which contains:  
- **60,000 images** for training  
- **10,000 images** for testing  

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing a single digit (0-9).  

## How It Works  

1. **Preprocess Data:** Normalize pixel values to improve model performance.  
2. **Train Models:** Use popular algorithms like:  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (for best accuracy)  
3. **Evaluate Results:** Test the model on unseen data to check accuracy.  
4. **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to recognize new handwritten digits.  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git  
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition  
   ```  

2. Install the required Python libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## How to Run  

1. **Explore and preprocess the data:**  
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py  
   ```  

2. **Train the model:**  
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py  
   ```  

3. **Evaluate the model:**  
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate_model.py  
   ```
